<h1 align="center"> Stray Animal Detection On Indian Roads Using YoloV8 and Custom CNN <a href="https://iiitr-nov-map-frontend.vercel.app/">(Demo Link)</a> </h1>

This web interface allows the users to see which stray animals (cat, dog, or cow) are present around them at any given instant. There are indicators on the map that depict a heat map indicating the density of stray animals around the userâ€™s location. Panning on the map lets the users see stray animals at multiple locations as well. Our database is polled every 5 seconds and the web app is populated with information about the stray animals in near real-time.
